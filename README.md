# Newsletter-Signup
Fully functional sign up page connected to Mailchimp and hosted by Heroku. 

For security purposes I have removed my API information. In order to see the functionality of the site, you must provide your own API key and List ID. Then you will need to change the change the global varibles in the app.js file (token and key). Without this, the sign up will default to the failure page once submitted.
